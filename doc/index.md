# Documentation for nmk - meta build system

**`nmk`** is an alternative "meta" build system, designed following these simple requirements:
* both multi-platform and easy install - available as a python module
* shareable/reusable/factorized build logic between projects
* language agnostic - each language support is done through plugins
